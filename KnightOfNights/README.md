# KnightOfNights

Mod for HK2025 Halloween event

## Plando

The Knight of Nights mod is intended to be experienced as a [plando](https://github.com/dplochcoder/HollowKnight.KnightOfNights/blob/main/KnightOfNights/Resources/Aides/Knight%20of%20Nights.zip), originally showcased at [Holloween 2025](https://youtu.be/D_9rEQ6JOII?t=21080).

It is designed to be completed by two runners working together via ItemSync, but can also be completed solo. The goal of the plando is to defeat all seven dream warriors. For a more harrowing experience, the goal is to obtain Void Heart.

See [SHO](https://www.smallhomothetyorganization.org/rando/plandoguide) for how to install and run plandos.

## Rando Integration

Knight of Nights introduces a new item named ||Revek Song|| which is integral to the plando experience. If desired, you can add this item to your randos.

There is no general logic integration for ||Revek Song|| and I have no plans to add it later; it is too grand a task. Thus even when added to rando, using it is never logically required.

There are three ways to turn this item on for your randos:

*   Start: Start with the item, though note it cannot be used without Dreamnail. Base rando settings can also grant Dreamnail if desired.
*   Vanilla: The item is placed at its "vanilla" location.
*   Randomized: The item is randomized with all the others, in the skills pool.
